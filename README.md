# Calculus-Powered Graphing App

## Overview
The **Calculus-Powered Graphing App** is a Python-based application that allows users to visualize mathematical functions, their derivatives, and their integrals. It provides an interactive interface for users to input functions, specify ranges, and choose what to plot. The app leverages numerical methods and Python libraries for computation and visualization.

## Features
- Input mathematical functions in Python syntax (e.g., `x**2 + 3*x + 5`).
- Compute and visualize:
  - The original function.
  - Its first derivative (using numerical differentiation).
  - Its integral (using numerical integration).
- Interactive CLI for user input.
- Graphical visualization using Matplotlib.

## Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates:
1. Application of numerical differentiation and integration techniques in programming.
2. Use of Python libraries (`NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Matplotlib`, `SymPy`) for mathematical computations and visualization.
3. Practical applications of calculus in computer science, such as data analysis, physics simulations, and machine learning.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `sympy`
