# Calculus-Powered Graphing App

## Overview
The **Calculus-Powered Graphing App** is a Python-based application that allows users to visualize mathematical functions, their derivatives, and their integrals. It provides an interactive and modern graphical user interface (GUI) built with PyQt5, enabling users to input functions, specify ranges, and customize what to plot. The app leverages numerical methods and Python libraries for computation and visualization.

## Features
- **Dark Mode**: A visually appealing dark theme for the entire application, including the graph.
- **Function Input**: Input mathematical functions in Python syntax (e.g., `x**2 + 3*x + 5`).
- **Graph Filtering**: Toggle visibility of the original function, its derivative, and its integral using checkboxes.
- **Dynamic Range Selection**: Specify custom ranges for `x_min` and `x_max` to adjust the graph.
- **Random Input Generator**: Generate random mathematical functions and ranges with a single click.
- **Save Graph**: Save the current graph as an image file (`graph.png`).
- **Reset Functionality**: Clear the graph and reset all inputs to their default state.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time updates to the graph based on user input.

## Learning Outcomes
